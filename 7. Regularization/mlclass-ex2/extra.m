%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
%
%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the logistic
%  regression exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoid.m
%     costFunction.m
%     predict.m
%     costFunctionReg.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Load Data
%  The first two columns contains the exam scores and the third column
%  contains the label.

data = load('ex2data1.txt');
X = data(:, [1, 2]); y = data(:, 3);

%% ==================== Part 1: Plotting ====================
%  We start the exercise by first plotting the data to understand the 
%  the problem we are working with.

fprintf(['Plotting data with + indicating (y = 1) examples and o ' ...
         'indicating (y = 0) examples.\n']);

%% ============ Part 2: Compute Cost and Gradient ============
%  In this part of the exercise, you will implement the cost and gradient
%  for logistic regression. You neeed to complete the code in 
%  costFunction.m

%  Setup the data matrix appropriately, and add ones for the intercept term
[m, n] = size(X);

% Add intercept term to x and X_test
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(n + 1, 1);

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient
[cost, grad] = costFunction(initial_theta, X, y);
