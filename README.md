This is my solutions and notes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere, then feel free to browse the code. 
You can also post a thread in the forum, explaining your thoughts. Some mentor will definitely help you.
